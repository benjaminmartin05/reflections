What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	You create a git repository in the directory you are currently in.
	This is needed so that you can add files to this repository, save them, and send them to
	github so others can see or improve the current work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is an area where changes can still be made, unlike the others which are already set
	in which files they have. This is helpful in case you accidentally begin to send something to github
	that you don't want to or you want to add something extra at the last minute. It also allows you to
	setup a note for what changes will currently be made to your repository.
