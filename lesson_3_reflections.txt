Lesson 3 Reflections:

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	If your collaborating on a project with others or if using multiple computers to work on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because someone else may have added files that you don't need on your remote repository at that time.
