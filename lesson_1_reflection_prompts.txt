How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was time consuming even though they were side by side, searching through every line of code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If you liked something you previously did, you can look at it.
    Also, if you make a mistake and things aren't working properly, you can go back a step.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: you know where you saved, saves can be broken however you want, they're offline
    Cons: you may forget to save after making many changes, your note wasnt clear, your computer locks up

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Some version control systems are more user efficient for professionals while others
    are used by people needing more help in not making an error. Certain VC's are used
    depending on what type of work you are doing as well.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log- Will log all the information on saves in that particular file your currently in
    git diff-When taking 2 of the save points from git log, you can see what changes were made between the two.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I have assurance with git checkout that I can go back to a previous save that
    doesn't have a bug or runs better instead of it being lost forever.
    I can go ahead and make changes knowing they aren't permanent.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to share projects on github and be able to pull others work to my computer.
    This is a great tool to collaborate on projects with.
